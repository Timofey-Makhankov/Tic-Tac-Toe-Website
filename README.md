## Introduction

We are a group of three who make a Tic-Tac-Toe website with the IPERKA system.
The IPERKA system are different easy steps to follow while making a projekt. The first task in IPERKA is to get informations. The second step is to plan your projext. Then you have to make some decisions about diffrent parts in your projekt. The you can realize your project. If you think you're done, you have to check if your project is working or if it have bugs in it. If it have bugs you have to fix them. If the project is done you have to evaluate what you did well or what you can make better next time.

## Information

At the beginning we had no idea what we should do. After some examples from our teacher we wanted to made code a calculator. We searched some informations about how to make a calculater but it is very complicated so we decided to make an other project. Timofey had the idea to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game on a website and we agreed. Under Sources you can see the links to which we did reasearch.

[Hosting providers](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-website-hosting-compared/) as comparison, but on further investigation we found a diffrent service that was suitable for our case called [Vercel](https://vercel.com/about)

## Decision

The first and most inportant point is the decision who does which task.

- Aurora - User-Interface with HTML & CSS
- Timofey - The backend with Javascript & J-Query
- Ruben - Writes the documentation and does the testing

We will also help each other if we need some help. Aurora decided to make the design with HTML and CSS because it's the only programming language she knows for frontend stuff. Timofey Decided to work with Java because he already did some stuff with Java and he uses J-Query for helping him to not write so much code. Ruben decide to write in a ReadMe file in our github, because everyone can change something in this file and it's easy for everyone to write in.

## Planning

We started to give each of us some tasks we have to work at. We also made a Docs file with the keydates of the project, the milestones, the To-Do list, the requirements and the description of the project.

Key Dates (Deadlines):

- 01.10.2022 - Submit Project Brief
- 05.11.2022 - Finish the learning Journal
- 06.11.2022 - Submit final project Document
- 07.11.2022 - project presentation

Information:
After some Research, We have decided on using Vercel. Because Itâ€™s free for hobbyists and is able to deploy with Javascript and not a static HTML Site.

Milestones:

- Finish the planning
- Having a well looking design
- Complete the coding phase
- Publish the Website
- Finish testing phase
- Having a working game
- The project is done

Criteria:

Decision / Log:

## Realization

To realize this project. We started simple: try to host a static HTML File on the local Network. After that create an Idea of how it might look like. We made a sketch drawing of it.

The sketch:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/sketch.jpeg" width="50%" align="justify">
</p>

We started to make the structure of the website with HTML. We then checked if the CSS Fiule would connect to the HTMl Files. We then started to create the stylesheets for the HTML files. We periodically checked the locally hosted website for the changes.

If the Outcome wasn't desired, we would try to resolve it.

Some Examples are:

- The button wasn't centered
- a button event wasn't executing
- wrong color and/or size

The next step was to implement Logic to the website with Javascript.
